# PasuNashi

First of all, this is **NOT** a secure password manager, since key to decrypt everything on the database is stored as an environment variable on the backend server.

This is a personal project in which I put all my effort to learn a lot of technologies, some new, and some not so much, like React Hooks, Typescript, Redux and its Hooks, and many more.

I always tried to follow standards, and respect good practices (something that I hadn't yet gotten used to...).

My original intention was to use Next JS for this project, but I ended up diciding to use React JS due to some problems I could'nt solve, and that I didn't know well how to handle the authentication in Next JS.

Whithout further ado, lets start with the documentation:

You can check out the docs generated with JsDocs on [this link](https://pasusewa.github.io/Web-Frontend/).

## How to initialize the project

First of all, you will need to properly set up the .env.local file. This projects include a .env.example file which shows what variables you need to fill up.

##### All the variables needed in the environment are the following:

1. REACT_APP_ENV_LOCAL: If there is nothing, the app will asume that the environment is "production", else, if there is anything, the app will change to "local" / "development" environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
2. REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY & REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY: These are required to use the Captcha component, you can get them signing up here: [Google ReCaptcha Admin Site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
   <br/>
   <br/>
3. REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID: This is your client ID for PayPal, you can get it on the [Developers Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com) site. Once signed up, create an application, and the go to the "live" credentials.
   No secret key is required to use the magic buttons of PayPal
   <br/>
   <br/>
4. REACT_APP_COINBASE_API_KEY: This is required to use the Coinbase API in order to let the user pay with cryptos.
   You can get your Coinbase credentials on [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Once you are done with all of that, the last thing is to run

    `npm install`

## Folder Structure

I don't know if this is a good practise or not, but I tried keep everything as simple as possible.

Basically, all the components that don't require a unit test, and don't use styles from Material-UI, are stored in their respective file, with the name of the component as the name of the file.

Then, the components that do have a test, and / or use the Material-UI styles, are stored in a folder with the name of the component, and with the test named as `componentName.test.tsx`, and styles as `styles.ts`.

And lastly, there are a few components that aren't used outside of 1 or 2 parent components, and those are stored inside of the folder of the parent component (for example the Drawer component, which is in src/comps/Navbar/Drawer since it isn't used outside of the navbar).

## Project Dependencies

Material UI - As the UI

Fontawesome - For the icons

Dexie - To handle all the interactions with Indexed DB (I don't recomment using it, its really simple to use, but very limited in my opinion).

react-google-recaptcha - As the Captcha component

react-hook-form - To handle all the forms

react-paypal-button-v2 - To create PayPal's magic buttons

react-qrcode-logo - For the QR codes

react-redux - To handle the global state

JsDocs and gh-pages - For the documenation

And lastly, this is not a dependency perse, but since I had a lot of problems using the package i18n, I decided to follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtaKTDNQ6vo&list=PLXlNY59rhzeIlEiTIznuqji-ORgKjEhGa) to make the translation system.
